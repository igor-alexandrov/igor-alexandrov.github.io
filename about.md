I am a Ruby/Rails and Crystal engineer, Open Source contributor, JetRockets CTO, and co-founder. I have been working with Ruby since 2008 and with Rails since 2009, and my overall commercial experience in programming is 20 years. I started working with Rails when it was at version 2.2 and never stopped since then.

As a company co-founder and CTO, I am highly involved in the employee technical growth process. I am always looking for new ways to improve technical processes and the code quality we deliver to our clients.

The best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else. That's why I mentor Ruby and Rails developers, and I am always open to new opportunities to share my knowledge and experience. One of the ways to do this is to write articles for this blog. I am also a speaker at Ruby conferences, meetups, and podcasts. You can find all my talks on the [dedicated page](speaking-opportunities) page.

As a hobby, I do diving (I hold PADI Rescue Diver certification) and woodworking. I live in Batumi with my beautiful wife and two wonderful daughters.
