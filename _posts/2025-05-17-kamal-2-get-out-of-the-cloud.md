I took the TropicalOnRails 2025 stage to challenge the status quo with the talk "Kamal 2 – Get Out of Cloud". In this bold session, I explored the possibilities and implications of running your infrastructure without relying on traditional cloud providers. Drawing from real-world experience and practical experimentation, I unpacked the motivations behind adopting Kamal 2, the architectural decisions involved, and what this shift means for scalability, cost, and developer control. A compelling talk for anyone curious about modern deployment strategies beyond the cloud.
